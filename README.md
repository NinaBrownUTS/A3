Hi! In my repository, I have uploaded the following files:

1. A text version of my Sonic Pi code - this way, if you would like to run it through the Sonic Pi software, you can just copy and paste the code into the app.
2. An audio recording of my Sonic Pi song - when you click 'raw file' (once inside the 'Sonic Pi Song Recording' file) it will then download onto your computer.
  
In the case of the audio file not working, here is a zip file of it: [Sonic Pi Song Recording.mp3.zip](https://github.com/NinaBrownUTS/A3/files/13363238/Sonic.Pi.Song.Recording.mp3.zip)

I hope you enjoy my creation!
